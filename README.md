# StreetHear - an Audio map of New York

http://StreetHear.io/

I recorded a bunch of 2-minute(ish) audio files on my iPhone at 
intersections in midtown Manhatten, mapped them out in 3d space 
using the HTML5 audio API, and used the embedded Google StreetView
API to move around the city.

The sounds fade in and out depending on where you are, and what
you're looking at.

## Collaboration

You can help! Make a short recording of the sound at a place
in New York, add the details to the JSON in the file header, and
upload the audio to audio/.
